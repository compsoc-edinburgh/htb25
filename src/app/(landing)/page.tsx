    question: "What am I supposed to build / hack during the weekend?",
    answer: "You have complete freedom in what you build at our hackathon! Don't worry about making your hack polished or perfect - we know there's limited time. We hope HackTheBurgh serves as a launchpad for you to start a project you can continue working on even after the event ends.",
